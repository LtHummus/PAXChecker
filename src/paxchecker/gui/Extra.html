    <h1>How Does This Updating Work?</h1>
    The program updates by comparing its current filesize with the program's filesize on my Dropbox account. If there's a different filesize, it
    assumes there's an update and prompts you to update. Please note that there is only one version available when updating (regardless of what type of
    update the program says it is) -- the most recent one that has been pushed. This can be a BETA, Minor, or Major version, and the only way to get a previous version is to<br>
    There are three types of updates that the program can notify you of:
    <ul>
      <li>BETA Version: These will be pushed frequently. These should only be used if you intend to help debug the program, are told to while debugging,
      or see a feature that you want in the Patch Notes. These versions can contain changes that can, at any time, break any or all features of the
      program and should therefore be used with caution.</li>
      <li>Minor Version: Minor versions are cumulative updates from the BETA versions that have been pushed. They generally contain bugfixes, new features,
      or performance improvements. It's recommended to update when these are found unless you have a reason not to.</li>
      <li>Major Version: Major versions are cumulative updates from the BETA and Minor versions that have been pushed. They contain large amounts of
      updates, including bugfixes, new features, or performance improvements. It's HIGHLY recommended to update when these are found.</li>
    </ul>
